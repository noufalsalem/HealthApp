# HealthApp (INCOMPLETE)

Forum web application focused on mental health. 

## Description

This was a university project that was eventually discarded after submission. Incomplete but most bases covered. 

## Help

As this was discarded, I would recommend against running the program as it has many dependencies and not worth it for an incomplete application.

## What I Learned 
- Angular and ASP.NET, as this was my first experience with those. 
- Importance of preparation (software requirements, etc) before development. 
- Reaching deadlines in time by prioritizing.
